    <h2>1. What distinguishes normal HTML from semantic HTML?</h2>
    <p>A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer. Examples of non-semantic elements: div and span - Tells nothing about its content. Examples of semantic elements: form, table, and article - Clearly defines its content.</p>

    <h2>2. Difference between closing tags and self closing tags?</h2>
    <p>A self-closing tag in HTML is a kind of HTML tag that does not need to be closed manually by its closing tag, which means it does not have a separate closing tag. Some few self-closing tags are input, hr, br, img <br> While closing tags requires to be manually closed example is div</p>

    <h2>3. Difference between inline and block elements?</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Block elements always start from a new line. Inline elements never start from a new line.
            </li>
            <li>
                Block elements cover space from left to right as far as it can go. Inline elements only cover the space as bounded by the tags in the HTML element.
            </li>
        </ul>
